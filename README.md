# Flash Card Creator
This project was created for the purpose of practicing node.js, constructors, and writing and reading local JSON files.

## Structure
flash-card.js is the launching point and serves as the controller. It either creates flash cards and saves them to a local JSON file via data-service.js, or it reads the local JSON files and prints them to the console via data-service.js.
